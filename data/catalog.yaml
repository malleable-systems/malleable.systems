        goals of tailorable systems with pluralism as a guiding value. Malleable
        software is made up of interface elements untangled from the closed
        worlds of apps, which can be developed by different authors and
        (re-)combined by end users."

        unusual to impossible, but in the browser it’s an everyday activity."

        only option for users is to petition the developer."
      - "There shouldn’t be a chasm that the user has to cross in order to
        customize the behavior of their software. Going from using to inspecting
        to modifying the system should be a gradual process where each of
        the steps is small enough to be easily discoverable. The user should not
        need to switch to “programmer mindset” but instead stay within the
        context of the application. They can stay close to their work and their

        prohibiting use of preexisting interfaces (“interface hiding”) outside

      - "Placing high-level tool support for integration and adaptation close to
        the user, for example within web application mashup platforms and

        us, where various important classes of artefacts, increasingly essential
        for everyday life, including participation in political and economic
        life, cannot be effectively owned by ordinary individuals."
      - "Many of the technological barriers to ownership, especially as regards
        software, can be seen as embedded in certain questions of “reuse” — one
        of the central affordances of ownership is the ability to transplant a
        thing from its original location to a different one, following the
        desires or person of the owner. For most kinds of software this is
        possible in only a crude way — an “application” can be installed on one
        machine rather than another — and with the rising prevalence of rental
        or cloud-based models for the deployment of software, it is decreasingly
        possible at all."
      - "If you find a piece of software that does something of value to you,
        **it should be possible to make it your own**. This implies that you can
        keep using it as part of the collection of tools you carry with you, in
        familiar contexts, or experiment with using it in novel contexts."

        requires software to be malleable by users, so they can appropriate
        documents and tools to meet individual needs; shareable among users, so
        they can collaborate on multiple aspects of the media; and distributable
        across heterogeneous devices and platforms."
      - "By sharing embedded code, behavior typically associated with
        application software can also be (collaboratively) manipulated, opening
        the way to novel possibilities for combining content, computation and
        interaction. Webstrates can be composed by embedding one webstrate
        within another, a process called transclusion [Nelson 1995], that lets
        users truly share, rather than copy, content."

    quotes:
      - "In this paper, we present spreadsheet-driven customization, a technique
        that enables end users to customize software without doing any
        traditional programming. The idea is to augment an application’s UI with
        a spreadsheet that is synchronized with the application’s data. When the
        user manipulates the spreadsheet, the underlying data is modified and
        the changes are propagated to the UI, and vice versa."
      - "Generic tools are especially important for software customization,
        because a common barrier to customizing software is not having enough
        time [Mackay 1991]—it’s more likely that people will customize software
        frequently if they can reuse the same tools across many applications."
      - "One of the most interesting properties of spreadsheets is that users
        familiar with only a tiny sliver of their functionality (e.g., storing
        tables of numbers and computing simple sums) can still use them in
        valuable ways. This supports the user’s natural motivation to continue
        using the tool, and to eventually learn its more powerful features if
        needed [Nardi and Miller 1991]."

    quotes:
      - "It is impossible to design systems which are appropriate for all users
        and all situations. We believe that a useful technique is to have end
        users tailor their systems to match their personal work practices. This
        requires not only systems which can be tailored, but a culture within
        which users feel in control of the system and in which tailoring is the
        norm."
      - "It is worth emphasising that we are interested here in skills required
        for tailoring. We do not intend to suggest that a 'programmer' is more
        skilled than a 'worker' in any absolute sense. If we were to focus on
        skills in the work domain, we would find that the worker was most
        skilled and the programmer least skilled."
      - "As a first step in growing a tailoring culture, we claim that **it
        should be as easy to change the environment as it is to use it**
        (clearly all changes one might want to make will not be so easy - but it
        is important that some should be)."
      - "A remarkable amount of tailoring can be done by relying on buttons
        produced by other people. Buttons can be kept in documents and can be
        easily passed around by email, thus they are a tool for the user
        community to augment the Xerox Lisp environment by combining individual
        innovation and by sharing improvements with others. The fact that
        small-grain improvements can easily 'diffuse' throughout the user
        community is a powerful principle for supporting user-driven evolution
        of systems."

        substantially more powerful instruments of educational and social change
        to the extent that such an image can be realized."

        their own systems and tools, giving them more of the powers that have
        only been available to programmers through writing code, so they can

        an alternative to traditional window and icon-based approaches to interface design."
      - "There are numerous benefits to metaphor-based approaches, but they also lead
        designers to employ computation primarily to mimic mechanisms of older media.
        While there are important cognitive, cultural, and engineering reasons
        to exploit earlier successful representations, this approach has the potential
        of underutilizing the mechanisms of new media."
      - "We envision a much richer world of dynamic persistent informational entities
        that operate according to multiple physics specifically designed to provide
        cognitively facile access. The physics need to be designed to exploit semantic
        relationships explicit and implicit in information-intensive tasks and in our
        interaction with these new kinds of computationally-based work materials."

    quotes:
      - "Consider how many web applications contain their own embedded ‘rich
        text’ editing widget. If linking were truly at the heart of the web’s
        design, a user (not just a developer) could supply their own preferred
        editor easily, but such a feat is almost always impossible. A convivial
        system should not contain multitudes; it should permit linking to them."
      - "The battle for convivial software in this sense appears similar to
        other modern struggles, such as the battle to avert climate disaster.
        Relying on local, individual rationality alone is a losing game: humans
        lack the collective consciousness that collective rationality would
        imply, and much human activity happens as the default result of ‘normal
        behaviour’. To shift this means to shift what is normal. Local
        incentives will play their part, but social doctrines, whether
        relatively transactional notions such as intergenerational contract, or
        quasi-spiritual notions of our evolved bond with the planet, also seem
        essential if there is to be hope of steering humans away from collective
        destruction."

        have to learn it, and you have relearn it at each update, and you have
        learn a different version when you shift from one vendor to another.
        (7:35)"
      - "...the key idea here is to make tools more generic, general, and
        independent of the environment in which they are going to be used.
        (12:50)"
      - "I often think about this [Samuel Johnson] quote from my late
        stepfather's desk: 'Nothing will ever be attempted if all possible
        objections must first be overcome.' (20:51)"
      - "I also strongly believe that users should have a bit more control over
        security and the risks they are willing to take. We learn by doing, we
        learn by failing, we learn by doing mistakes, we learn by breaking
        things. And sometimes I want a secure environment and sometimes I want
        to see what happens if I put my fingers in the plug. (21:17)"

      - "**Software is now organized into static machines called
        *applications***. These applications (“appliances” is a better word)
        come equipped with a fixed vocabulary of actions, speak no common
        language, and [cannot be extended, composed, or
        combined](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faJ8N0giqzw) with other
        applications except with enormous friction."
      - "Applications can and ultimately should be replaced by *programming
        environments*, explicitly recognized as such, in which the user
        interactively creates, executes, inspects and *composes* programs."
      - "Applications are failing at even their stated goal, but they do worse
        than that. Yes, an application is an (often terrible) interface to some
        library of functions, but it also traps this wonderful collection of
        potential building blocks in a mess of bureaucratic red tape."
      - "No one piece of software ‘does it all’, and so individuals and
        businesses looking to automate or partially automate various tasks are
        often put in the position of having to integrate functionality across
        multiple applications, which is often painful or flat out impossible.
        The amount of lost productivity (or lost leisure time) on a global
        scale, both for individuals and business, is absolutely staggering."
      - "As a civilization, we would be better off if software could be
        developed by small, unrelated groups, with an open standard that allowed
        for these groups to trivially combine functionality produced anywhere on
        the network."
      - "The problem is, I don’t want a machine, I want a toolkit, and Google
        keeps trying to sell me machines. Perhaps these machines are exquisitely
        crafted, with extensive tuning and so forth, but a machine with a fixed
        set of actions can never do all the things that *I* can imagine might be
        useful, and I *don’t* want to wait around for Google to implement the
        functionality I desire as another awkward one-off ‘feature’ that’s
        poorly integrated and just adds more complexity to an already bloated
        application."

      - "People don’t only learn to cook so they can become chefs. Some do!
        But far more people learn to cook so they can eat better, or more
        affordably, or in a specific way. Or because they want to carry on a
        tradition. Sometimes they learn just because they’re bored! Or even
        because — get this — they love spending time with the person who’s
        teaching them... I will gently suggest that perhaps coding might be
        entangled the same way... with our domesticity and comfort, nerdiness

    quotes:
      - "Great tools for thought rarely come from contexts focused on creating
        tools. They’re usually created in the course of deep creative work in
        some domain, almost as a byproduct. And they’re usually made by people
        with significant expertise and investment in those creative problems."
      - "In most domains, great tool-makers are rarely great tool-users, and
        vice-versa. There might be advantages to separating the work: the
        tool-maker could constantly consider abstraction and generalization,
        and the tool-user could focus on meaningful problems at hand without
        being distracted by issues of systematization."
      - "There’s a tricky chicken-and-egg problem here. If great creative work
        should drive the invention of new mediums, how can the initial idea
        driving the creative work get started in the first place?"
      - "The pair must proactively develop an _armory_ of tool ideas to equip
        the tool-user’s explorations. Tool ideas in the armory don’t have to
        be working software. They just have to be understood well enough that
        the tool-user can tinker with them in emerging creative projects."
      - "This conception is mostly useful in the context of repeated
        collaborations, particularly across distinct projects."
