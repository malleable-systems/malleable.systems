quotes:
  - Currently, only those who have a programming background or resources have
    the ability to create digital artifacts. This forces the rest of the world
    to be consumers, rather than creators or authors. When creating digital
    products, our conception of target audience is "users". The notion of
    "users" sometimes assumes that their main goal is consuming instead of
    playing, creating, or conversing. What if the digital environment was
    inclusive enough for anyone to create? How can we provide the tools that
    will enable everyone to become authors?
