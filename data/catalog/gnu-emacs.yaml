quotes:
  - Extensible means that you can go beyond simple customization and create
    entirely new commands. New commands are simply programs written in the Lisp
    language, which are run by Emacs's own Lisp interpreter. Existing commands
    can even be redefined in the middle of an editing session, without having to
    restart Emacs. Most of the editing commands in Emacs are written in Lisp;
    the few exceptions could have been written in Lisp but use C instead for
    efficiency. — _[GNU Emacs manual,
    Introduction](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Intro.html#Intro)_
  - Org can be used as a TODO lists manager and as a planner. Org is a great
    plain-text table editor. Org is an authoring and publication tool. Org makes
    literate programming a handy and natural way to deal with code. — _[Org mode
    feature list](https://orgmode.org/features.html)_
  - This appendix covers some areas where users can extend the functionality of
    Org. — _[Org mode manual, Appendix A
