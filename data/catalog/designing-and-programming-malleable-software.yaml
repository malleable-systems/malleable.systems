quotes:
  - The contemporary landscape of interactive software operates as a
    "designer-knows-best" model that gives users very few opportunities to
    change their software or to make different pieces of software work together
    as they see fit.
  - I introduce malleable software as a design vision that reconstructs the
    goals of tailorable systems with pluralism as a guiding value. Malleable
    software is made up of interface elements untangled from the closed worlds
    of apps, which can be developed by different authors and (re-)combined by
    end users.
