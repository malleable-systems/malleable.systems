quotes:
  - HyperCard is a software erector set that lets non-programmers put together
    interactive information — _Bill Atkinson, [Computer
    Chronicles](https://archive.org/details/CC501_hypercard) (1987)_
  - HyperCard's biggest win was a very low entry threshold for those who wanted
    to build their own 'stacks' - combinations of user interface, code, and
    persistent data. There were plenty of examples to suggest ideas, and all the
    code was open for tweaking. — _Tim Oren, [A Eulogy for
    HyperCard](https://due-diligence.typepad.com/blog/2004/03/a_eulogy_for_hy.html)
    (2004)_
