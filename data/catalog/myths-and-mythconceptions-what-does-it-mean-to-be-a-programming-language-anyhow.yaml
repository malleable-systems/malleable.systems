quotes:
  - The steep learning curve for these languages is a barrier to entry for many
    people. Part of the reward for this effort is an associated mystique about
    having mastered the special knowledge.
  - As computation has become pervasive, more and more people who are not
    professionally trained as programmers are creating and tailoring software as
    a means to achieve goals of their own. These vernacular software developers
    are principally interested in their own tasks, not in the software as a
    primary objective.
  - Many *vernacular software developers* are highly trained in their own
    domains and only lightly trained in traditional programming. They use a
    variety of tools and notations including spreadsheets, scripting, data
    schemas, markups, domain-specific languages, visual web development tools,
    and scientific libraries.
  - Without adequate specifications for the components, thereâ€™s no way to reason
    formally about the result. When owners of components can change them without
    notice, users have no assurances. As a result, formal verification is, on
    the whole, a minor player for real software.
