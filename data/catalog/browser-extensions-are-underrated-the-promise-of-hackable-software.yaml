  - Among major software platforms today, browser extensions are the rare
    exception that allow and encourage users to modify the apps that we use, in
    creative ways not intended by their original developers. On smartphone and
    desktop platforms, this sort of behavior ranges from unusual to impossible,
    but in the browser it’s an everyday activity.
  - Since the beginning of personal computing, there’s been a philosophical
    tradition that encourages using computers as an interactive medium where
    people contribute their own ideas and build their own tools—authorship over
    consumption.
