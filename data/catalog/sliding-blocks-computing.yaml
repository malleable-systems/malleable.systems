quotes:
  - Consider the AND mini-puzzle. Suppose the goal is to slide the upper
    protruding block into the box? The answer is that first the left block and
    the bottom block must both be slid out one unit. This will let the internal
    blocks slide to free up space for the upper block to slide in.
