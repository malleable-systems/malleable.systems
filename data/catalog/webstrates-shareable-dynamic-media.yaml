quotes:
  - Webstrates offer a novel approach for creating shareable dynamic media that
    blur the distinction between documents and applications. Our vision requires
    software to be malleable by users, so they can appropriate documents and
    tools to meet individual needs; shareable among users, so they can
    collaborate on multiple aspects of the media; and distributable across
    heterogeneous devices and platforms.
  - By sharing embedded code, behavior typically associated with application
    software can also be (collaboratively) manipulated, opening the way to novel
    possibilities for combining content, computation and interaction. Webstrates
    can be composed by embedding one webstrate within another, a process called
    transclusion [Nelson 1995], that lets users truly share, rather than copy,
    content.
