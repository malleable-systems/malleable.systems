quotes:
  - "This paper tells the story of the development of BETA: a programming
    language with just one abstraction mechanism, instead of one abstraction
    mechanism for each kind of program element (classes, types, procedures,
    functions, etc.). The paper explains how this single abstraction mechanism,
    the pattern, came about and how it was designed to be so powerful that it
    covered the other mechanisms."
  - The BETA project was started in 1976 and was originally supposed to be
    completed in a year or two. For many reasons, it evolved into an almost
    lifelong activity involving Nygaard, the authors of this paper and many
    others. The BETA project became an endeavor for discussing issues related to
    programming languages, programming and informatics in general.
