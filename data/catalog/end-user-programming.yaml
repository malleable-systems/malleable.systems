quotes:
  - Desktop programs, web apps, and smartphone apps are to various degrees like
    appliances with a hermetic seal to keep users out of their interior. If
    there is not already a button for a given function, the only option for
    users is to petition the developer.
  - There shouldn’t be a chasm that the user has to cross in order to customize
    the behavior of their software. Going from using to inspecting to modifying
    the system should be a gradual process where each of the steps is small
    enough to be easily discoverable. The user should not need to switch to
    “programmer mindset” but instead stay within the context of the application.
    They can stay close to their work and their ideas.
