description: I've been interested for a while in symbolic visual programming,
  and I made a IDE to test some ideas around writing GUIs entirely in [multiset
  rewrite rules](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/fractran.html). Tote is a
  playground that lets me play with some of these ideas. I think it's relevant
  to malleable systems because it presents programming in its most elementary
  form(a single while loop), and can be implemented easily on near anything at
  all, in fact, all you need for this is a bag with marbles of different shapes
  or color.
