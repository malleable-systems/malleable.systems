quotes:
  - The hermetic, self-hosted, self-sustainable, recursively exportable,
    offline-first, file-first, web-based reactive open-source programming
    substrate built on observable runtime is online finally!
  - The editing experience is not there yet. Probably wiser to fork the
    [original

    notebook if you seriously want to create a webpage.
