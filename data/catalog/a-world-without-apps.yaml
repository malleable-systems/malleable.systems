quotes:
  - ...with apps today, you are given full, complex software where you don't
    have a choice. You have to have all of it or none of it, and you have to
    learn it, and you have relearn it at each update, and you have learn a
    different version when you shift from one vendor to another. (7:35)
  - ...the key idea here is to make tools more generic, general, and independent
    of the environment in which they are going to be used. (12:50)
  - "I often think about this [Samuel Johnson] quote from my late stepfather's
    desk: 'Nothing will ever be attempted if all possible objections must first
    be overcome.' (20:51)"
  - I also strongly believe that users should have a bit more control over
    security and the risks they are willing to take. We learn by doing, we learn
    by failing, we learn by doing mistakes, we learn by breaking things. And
    sometimes I want a secure environment and sometimes I want to see what
    happens if I put my fingers in the plug. (21:17)
  - I don't think it is incompatible to have more flexible environments and
    security. What I'm advocating for is the ability for people to make choices.

  - I do not believe that this type of change will come from the companies that
    dominate computing at the moment, in the same way that GUIs didn't come out
    of IBM at the time. (30:43)
  - My take is not to try to directly address the wider audience, but to try
    with niche markets. (31:20)
