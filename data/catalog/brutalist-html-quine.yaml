    `<p>`A different but somehow related topic I like is `<a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist_architecture">`[brutalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist_architecture)`</a>`,
    in particular, this often overlooked aspect:`</p>`

    `<blockquote>`Another common theme in Brutalist designs is the exposure of the building's functions.`</blockquote>`

    `<p>`...the tendency to **`<strong>`make the internal external`</strong>`**, and reveal the secrets of the building, in a somehow.... *`<em>`brutaful`</em>`* way. ;-).`</p>`
