  - In this paper, we present spreadsheet-driven customization, a technique that
    enables end users to customize software without doing any traditional
    programming. The idea is to augment an application’s UI with a spreadsheet
    that is synchronized with the application’s data. When the user manipulates
    the spreadsheet, the underlying data is modified and the changes are
    propagated to the UI, and vice versa.
  - Generic tools are especially important for software customization, because a
    common barrier to customizing software is not having enough time [Mackay
    1991]—it’s more likely that people will customize software frequently if
    they can reuse the same tools across many applications.
  - One of the most interesting properties of spreadsheets is that users
    familiar with only a tiny sliver of their functionality (e.g., storing
    tables of numbers and computing simple sums) can still use them in valuable
    ways. This supports the user’s natural motivation to continue using the
    tool, and to eventually learn its more powerful features if needed [Nardi
    and Miller 1991].
