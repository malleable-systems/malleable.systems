quotes:
  - '**Software is now organized into static machines called *applications***.
    These applications ("appliances" is a better word) come equipped with a
    fixed vocabulary of actions, speak no common language, and [cannot be
    extended, composed, or combined](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faJ8N0giqzw)
    with other applications except with enormous friction.'
  - Applications can and ultimately should be replaced by *programming
    environments*, explicitly recognized as such, in which the user
    interactively creates, executes, inspects and *composes* programs.
  - Applications are failing at even their stated goal, but they do worse than
    that. Yes, an application is an (often terrible) interface to some library
    of functions, but it also traps this wonderful collection of potential
    building blocks in a mess of bureaucratic red tape.
  - No one piece of software 'does it all', and so individuals and businesses
    looking to automate or partially automate various tasks are often put in the
    position of having to integrate functionality across multiple applications,
    which is often painful or flat out impossible. The amount of lost
    productivity (or lost leisure time) on a global scale, both for individuals
    and business, is absolutely staggering.
  - As a civilization, we would be better off if software could be developed by
    small, unrelated groups, with an open standard that allowed for these groups
    to trivially combine functionality produced anywhere on the network.
  - The problem is, I don’t want a machine, I want a toolkit, and Google keeps
    trying to sell me machines. Perhaps these machines are exquisitely crafted,
    with extensive tuning and so forth, but a machine with a fixed set of
    actions can never do all the things that *I* can imagine might be useful,
    and I *don’t* want to wait around for Google to implement the functionality
    I desire as another awkward one-off 'feature' that’s poorly integrated and
    just adds more complexity to an already bloated application.
