  - It is impossible to design systems which are appropriate for all users and
    all situations. We believe that a useful technique is to have end users
    tailor their systems to match their personal work practices. This requires
    not only systems which can be tailored, but a culture within which users
    feel in control of the system and in which tailoring is the norm.
  - It is worth emphasising that we are interested here in skills required for
    tailoring. We do not intend to suggest that a 'programmer' is more skilled
    than a 'worker' in any absolute sense. If we were to focus on skills in the
    work domain, we would find that the worker was most skilled and the
    programmer least skilled.
  - As a first step in growing a tailoring culture, we claim that **it should be
    as easy to change the environment as it is to use it** (clearly all changes
    one might want to make will not be so easy - but it is important that some
    should be).
  - A remarkable amount of tailoring can be done by relying on buttons produced
    by other people. Buttons can be kept in documents and can be easily passed
    around by email, thus they are a tool for the user community to augment the
    Xerox Lisp environment by combining individual innovation and by sharing
    improvements with others. The fact that small-grain improvements can easily
    'diffuse' throughout the user community is a powerful principle for
    supporting user-driven evolution of systems.
