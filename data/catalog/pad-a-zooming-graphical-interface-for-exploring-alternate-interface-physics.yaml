  - ... Pad++, an infinite resolution sketchpad that we are exploring as an
    alternative to traditional window and icon-based approaches to interface
    design.
  - There are numerous benefits to metaphor-based approaches, but they also lead
    designers to employ computation primarily to mimic mechanisms of older
    media. While there are important cognitive, cultural, and engineering
    reasons to exploit earlier successful representations, this approach has the
    potential of underutilizing the mechanisms of new media.
  - We envision a much richer world of dynamic persistent informational entities
    that operate according to multiple physics specifically designed to provide
    cognitively facile access. The physics need to be designed to exploit
    semantic relationships explicit and implicit in information-intensive tasks
    and in our interaction with these new kinds of computationally-based work
    materials.
