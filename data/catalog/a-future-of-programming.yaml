quotes:
  - Enable everyone, especially people from other domains outside programming,
    to take advantage of computation. Empower people to build their own systems
    and tools, giving them more of the powers that have only been available to
    programmers through writing code, so they can augment their own workflows in
    their own areas of expertise.
  - Blur the line between developers and users. Enable people to modify the
    systems and tools they use and adapt them to their needs.
