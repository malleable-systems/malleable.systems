quotes:
  - Unix abstractions are fairly simple and fairly general, but they are not
    humane, and they invite fragmentation. By 'not humane', I mean that they are
    error-prone and difficult to experiment with interactively. By
    'fragmentation', I mean they invite building higher-level abstractions in
    mutually opaque and incompatible ways (think language VMs, file formats,
    middlewares...). To avoid these, liballocs is a minimal extension of
    Unix-like abstractions broadly in the spirit of Smalltalk-style dynamism,
    designed to counter both of these problems.
