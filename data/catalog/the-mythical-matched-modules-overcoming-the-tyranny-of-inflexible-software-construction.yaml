quotes:
  - 'Conventional tools yield expensive and inflexible software. ... I propose
    that a solution must radically separate the concern of integration in
    software: firstly by using novel tools specialised towards integration (the
    "**integration domain**"), and secondly by prohibiting use of preexisting
    interfaces ("interface hiding") outside that domain.'
  - Placing high-level tool support for integration and adaptation close to the
    user, for example within web application mashup platforms and browser
    extensions has already led to added-value innovations which could not have
    been anticipated by the creators of the underlying software.
