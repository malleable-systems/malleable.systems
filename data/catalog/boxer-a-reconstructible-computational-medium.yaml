quotes:
  - One major benefit of programmability is that even professionally produced
    items become changeable, adaptable, fragmentable, and quotable in ways that
    present software is not.
  - ... a reconstructible medium should allow people to build personalized
    computational tools and easily modify tools they have gotten from others.
    This concept is in strong contrast to the current situation in applications
    software â€” professionals are designing tools only for large populations with
    a common need.
  - Boxer challenges, in a small way, the current view of programming languages.
    More significantly, it challenges the current view of what programming might
    be like, and for whom and for what purposes programming languages should be
    created. We have argued that some computer languages should be designed for
    laypeople, and have presented an image of how computation could be used as
    the basis for a popular, expressive, and reconstructible medium. Computers
    will become substantially more powerful instruments of educational and
    social change to the extent that such an image can be realized.
