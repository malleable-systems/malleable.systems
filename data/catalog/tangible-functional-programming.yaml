quotes:
  - We present a user-friendly approach to unifying program creation and
    execution, based on a notion of “tangible values” (TVs), which are visual
    and interactive manifestations of pure values, including functions.
    Programming happens by gestural composition of TVs. Our goal is to give
    end-users the ability to create parameterized, composable content without
    imposing the usual abstract and linguistic working style of programmers. We
    hope that such a system will put the essence of programming into the hands
    of many more people, and in particular people with artistic/visual creative
    style.
