  - 'What makes a piece of software a "place" vs a "tool" or an "appliance"? ...
    I think some notion of **limitlessness and nesting** are necessary. [The
    feeling of a "place"] seems to come from some kind of limitlessness: Notion
    has infinite hierarchies, Figma has an infinite canvas. ... This definition
    matters to me because appliances are static, but places can be occupied and
    changed. You can have memories and experiences in them. Things can grow in
    them. New stuff can emerge. Communities can form. I want more software to be
    like that.'
