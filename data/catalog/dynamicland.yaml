quotes:
  - Dynamicland is a communal computer, designed for agency, not apps, where
    people can think like whole humans.
  - No normal person sees an app and thinks 'I can make that myself.' Or even 'I
    can modify that to do what I actually need.' Computational media in
    Dynamicland feels like stuff anyone can make. ... A humane dynamic medium
    gently leads people down a path from playing, to crafting, to remixing, to
    programming.
  - Dynamicland is an authoring environment, and everyone is an author. People
    make what they need for themselves. They learn through immersion. The true
    power of the dynamic medium — programmability — is for everyone.
