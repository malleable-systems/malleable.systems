quotes:
  - Decker builds on the legacy of
    [HyperCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard) and the visual
    aesthetic of classic macOS. It retains the simplicity and ease of learning
    that HyperCard provided, while adding many subtle and overt quality-of-life
    improvements, like deep undo history, support for scroll wheels and
    touchscreens, more modern keyboard navigation, and bulk editing operations.
  - Anyone can use Decker to create E-Zines, organize their notes, give
    presentations, build adventure games, or even just doodle some 1-bit pixel
    art. The holistic "ditherpunk" aesthetic is cozy, a bit nostalgic, and
    provides fun and distinctive creative constraints. As a prototyping tool,
    Decker encourages embracing a sketchy, imperfect approach. Finished decks
    can be saved as standalone .html documents which self-execute in a web
    browser and can be shared anywhere you can host or embed a web page. Decker
    also runs natively on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
