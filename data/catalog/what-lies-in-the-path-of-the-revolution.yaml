quotes:
  - We argue that a form of "**digital serfdom**" has rapidly grown up around
    us, where various important classes of artefacts, increasingly essential for
    everyday life, including participation in political and economic life,
    cannot be effectively owned by ordinary individuals.
  - Many of the technological barriers to ownership, especially as regards
    software, can be seen as embedded in certain questions of "reuse" — one of
    the central affordances of ownership is the ability to transplant a thing
    from its original location to a different one, following the desires or
    person of the owner. For most kinds of software this is possible in only a
    crude way — an "application" can be installed on one machine rather than
    another — and with the rising prevalence of rental or cloud-based models for
    the deployment of software, it is decreasingly possible at all.
  - If you find a piece of software that does something of value to you, **it
    should be possible to make it your own**. This implies that you can keep
    using it as part of the collection of tools you carry with you, in familiar
    contexts, or experiment with using it in novel contexts.
