quotes:
  - I made a messaging app for, and with, my family. It is ruthlessly simple; we
    love it; no one else will ever use it.
  - In a better world, I would have built this in a day using some kind of
    modern, flexible HyperCard for iOS, exporting a sturdy, standalone app that
    did exactly what I wanted and nothing else.
  - People don’t only learn to cook so they can become chefs. Some do! But far
    more people learn to cook so they can eat better, or more affordably, or in
    a specific way. Or because they want to carry on a tradition. Sometimes they
    learn just because they’re bored! Or even because — get this — they love
    spending time with the person who’s teaching them... I will gently suggest
    that perhaps coding might be entangled the same way... with our domesticity
    and comfort, nerdiness and curiosity, health and love.
