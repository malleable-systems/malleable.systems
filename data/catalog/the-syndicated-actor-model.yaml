    Functional programs are easy to write, but programs that interact with each
    other and the outside world are much harder.

    Programming models like the Actor model and the Tuplespace model make great strides toward simplifying programs that communicate. However, a few key difficulties remain.

    The Syndicated Actor model addresses these difficulties. It is closely related to both Actors and Tuplespaces, but builds on a different underlying primitive: *eventually-consistent replication of state* among actors. Its design also draws on widely deployed but informal ideas like publish/subscribe messaging.

    Three big ideas fit together to yield the complete vision:

    ### Syndicated Actor Model

    Integrates Actors with Tuplespace-like shared state, Ambients-like treatment of system boundaries, and Erlang-like techniques for signalling and recovering from partial failure. A special kind of syndicated actor, a dataspace, routes and replicates published data according to actorsâ€™ interests.

    ### Conversational Concurrency

    A way of thinking about IPC and networking, going beyond message-passing to include ideas of conversational frame and conversational state.

    ### Syndicate Domain-Specific Language

    Extends programming languages with domain-specific language (DSL) constructs for directly expressing syndicated actor and conversational concepts.
