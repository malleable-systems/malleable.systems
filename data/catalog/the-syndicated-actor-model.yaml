    Functional programs are easy to write, but programs that interact with each
    other and the outside world are much harder.

    Programming models like the Actor model and the Tuplespace model make great strides toward simplifying programs that communicate. However, a few key difficulties remain.

    The Syndicated Actor model addresses these difficulties. It is closely related to both Actors and Tuplespaces, but builds on a different underlying primitive: *eventually-consistent replication of state* among actors. Its design also draws on widely deployed but informal ideas like publish/subscribe messaging.
