quotes:
  - ERIS is an encoding of arbitrary content into a set of uniformly sized,
    encrypted and content-addressed blocks as well as a short identifier that
    can be encoded as an URN. The content can be reassembled from the blocks
    only with this identifier. The encoding is defined independent of any
    storage and transport layer or any specific application.
