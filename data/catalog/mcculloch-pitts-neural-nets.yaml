description: In exploring parallel rewriting systems, I stumbled onto something
  like neural networks and it pushed me to dive deeper into the topic and
  learning how they worked. I was surprised how capable this nice little OISC
  was. I implemented a textual graph representation language and runtime in
  about [150 lines of C89](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/etc/neur.c.txt), or about
  [300 lines of Uxn](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/etc/neur.tal.txt). I think this is
  relevant to the Malleable community due to it being a symbolic system which is
  popular with malleable systems, as well as people exploring portable and
  parallel computation models.
