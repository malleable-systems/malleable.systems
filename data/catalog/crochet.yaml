quotes:
  - Crochet goes to great lengths to make creating, running and remixing content
    as safe and privacy respecting as possible. Content built with Crochet can
    only use your computer and your data in ways you explicitly consent to---it
    can't change your files or send your information over the internet without
    your knowledge and consent.
  - 'One of the core principles of Crochet is that you should feel safe to
    experiment with your computer as much as you want, without having to worry
    about questions like: "If I install this application, will it try to steal
    my files?" or "What if I try this and it breaks my computer?"'
  - Crochet is a "language-driven" system, through the lenses that we interact
    with computational concepts through languages; Even "direct manipulation"
    forms a language, where the ways in which we can manipulate things is
    dictated by a set of composable rules. A system like this, heavily dependent
    on tooling, needs ways in which users can extend the system to fit their own
    context. This means that Crochet has to support user-extensible IDEs,
    user-extensible Debuggers, user-extensible REPLs, etc. And these users
    should be able to modify any aspect of these tools to fit new languages
    (interactions, manipulations, rules, etc).
