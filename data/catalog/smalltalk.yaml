quotes:
  - The message is the most fundamental language construct in Smalltalk. Even
    control structures are implemented as message sends. —
    [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk)
  - "The late-bound, message-based interfaces of objects provide strong
    interposability properties: clients remain oblivious of the speciﬁc
    implementation they are talking to. In turn, this simpliﬁes the
    customisation, extension or replacement of parts of a system, all of which
    can be rendered as interposition of a different object on the same client. —
