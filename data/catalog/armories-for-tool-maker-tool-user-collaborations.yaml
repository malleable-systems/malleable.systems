quotes:
  - Great tools for thought rarely come from contexts focused on creating tools.
    They’re usually created in the course of deep creative work in some domain,
    almost as a byproduct. And they’re usually made by people with significant
    expertise and investment in those creative problems.
  - "In most domains, great tool-makers are rarely great tool-users, and
    vice-versa. There might be advantages to separating the work: the tool-maker
    could constantly consider abstraction and generalization, and the tool-user
    could focus on meaningful problems at hand without being distracted by
    issues of systematization."
  - There’s a tricky chicken-and-egg problem here. If great creative work should
    drive the invention of new mediums, how can the initial idea driving the
    creative work get started in the first place?
  - The pair must proactively develop an _armory_ of tool ideas to equip the
    tool-user’s explorations. Tool ideas in the armory don’t have to be working
    software. They just have to be understood well enough that the tool-user can
    tinker with them in emerging creative projects.
  - This conception is mostly useful in the context of repeated collaborations,
    particularly across distinct projects.
