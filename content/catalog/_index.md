This catalog highlights projects, people, groups, research, discussions, and
other initiatives in the malleable software community. It is our hope that
bringing more awareness to these efforts will lead to greater collaboration and
better systems for us all that support the [essential principles][principles] of
malleability.

If you know of people, projects, threads, or anything else that should be added,
please [edit the wiki][catalog-wiki] or [send us a note][feedback]. Similarly,
please let us know about anything that should be removed or corrected.

_Order in the catalog is randomised on each page load._
