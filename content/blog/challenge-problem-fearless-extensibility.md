Over on the [community forum][forum], we're trying out a new activity called a
"challenge problem" where we focus on a theme for several months through
submissions that may take various different forms. It's like a hybrid between a
virtual workshop and a game jam.

For our first challenge problem, the theme is "fearless extensibility". Why
"fearless"...? Allowing extension authors complete freedom to change all aspects
of a system may seem like a malleable path to take, but it carries with it
maintenance and security headaches. How can we achieve powerful extensibility to
configure systems to meet our individual needs while also reducing security and
maintainability risks?

If this sounds interesting to you, please see the [challenge problem
thread][thread] for additional context and submission details. Submissions are
due on 2024-11-01.
