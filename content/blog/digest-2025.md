## Matrix

Our [Matrix room][matrix] was fairly quiet this year. I recommend joining the
forum if you haven't already.

## Looking ahead

Are there malleable-focused projects you wish you could pursue,
if only there were some funding available to support your work?
We may work towards some form of grant funding program in the future.
Let us know in the [grant funding forum thread][grant]
if this would be of interest to you.
