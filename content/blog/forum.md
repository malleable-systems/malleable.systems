Do you have malleable ideas or projects you'd like to discuss, but you've been
wishing there were a more structured medium for longer conversations than just
the [Matrix room][matrix]?

Try out our new [community forum][forum]! ðŸŽ‰

Along with a forum-style interface for general discussion, there's also special
support for our catalog, which is now easily [editable][catalog-about] via
[wiki-style posts][catalog-wiki] on the forum.

The Matrix room will continue to live on in parallel with the forum. Come on by
the forum and share your malleable ideas and projects. ðŸ˜„
