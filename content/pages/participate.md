We hope the collective's [mission][mission] has inspired you to follow the
community's work, post your thoughts, and share your experiments. There are many
ways to get involved and contribute to this movement.

### Discuss

We have various ways to share and discuss work from the community:

* Follow and mention the community on [Twitter][twitter]
* Chat with us in our [Matrix room][matrix]
* Read the community [blog][blog] where we share projects and essays in various
  states of completion
* Subscribe to the [newsletter][newsletter] if you prefer to receive the blog
  content via email

### Contribute

We'd like to host several kinds of posts from different voices in the community.
If you'd like to write something, please [get in touch][feedback].

Some of the types of content we have in mind include:

* Summaries of papers and projects in the community
* Reports of experiments in progress
* Essays on what malleable software should be and how we can get there

Along with the blog, we've also started a [catalog][catalog] of projects,
people, discussions, and other efforts in this field. We hope it can grow to
become a comprehensive list of resources for the community.

### Feedback

At the end of the day, we want this to be a space for anyone working to advance
the goals of malleable software. If you have thoughts or feedback on how best to
achieve that, please let us know.
